# MyiOSCalculator

Clone of the iOS Calculator app written in SwiftUI by Davis Atwell.
11/7/2022

## App Description

The calculator preforms simple mathematical arithmetic functions (+, -, /,*) and allows operation chaining on both positive and negative integers and decimal values that result from a prior calculation. I utilized a portion of the MVC design pattern learned in Comp 301 here at UNC along with the knowledge gained throughout iOS academy to implement this calculator that has an user interface with the 2022 App Team Colorway.
